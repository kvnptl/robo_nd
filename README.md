# Robotics Software Engineer nanodegree - Udacity

Introduction

Begin your exploration into the world of robotics software engineering with a practical, system-focused approach to programming robots using the ROS framework and C++. In addition, learn and apply robotics software engineering algorithms such as localization, mapping, and navigation.

Project list:
1. **Build My World** (Gazebo World)
- Use Gazebo to simulate a robotic environment comprised of a building to house your future robot. Skills you will apply: Gazebo, C++ plugins.
- TODO: add screenshot from project or GIF
2. **Go Chase It!** (ROS Essentials)
- Use the Robot Operating System (ROS) to design a mobile robot. Then, house your newly-designed robot in the robotic environment you built in Project 1. You will program your robot with C++ to chase a ball through this world. Skills you will apply: catkin workspaces, ROS packages, ROS nodes, ROS launch files, RViz integration, and C++.

3. **Where Am I?** (Localization)
- Use the Monte Carlo Localization algorithm in ROS, in conjunction with sensor data and a map of the world, to estimate a mobile robot’s position and orientation so that your robot can answer the question “Where am I?” Skills you will apply: Localization algorithms: Kalman Filter and MCL, ROS parameters, ROS packages integration, C++.

4. **Map My World** (Mapping and SLAM)
- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) can be implemented in a number of ways depending on the sensors used via various ROS packages. Use a ROS SLAM package and simulated sensor data to create an agent that can both map the world around it, and localize within it. Skills you will apply: Mapping and SLAM algorithms, Occupancy Grid Mapping, Grid-based FastSLAM and GraphSLAM, ROS debugging tools, C++.

5. **Home Service Robot** (Path Planning and Navigation)
- Combine everything you’ve learned in this program to simulate a home service robot that can map, localize, and navigate to transport objects, moving from one room to another autonomously. Skills you will apply: Path Planning search algorithms, ROS navigation stack, C++.
